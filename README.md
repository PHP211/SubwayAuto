Subway Surfer Auto-Player using LSTM
This repository contains a project that builds an automated playing system for Subway Surfer using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The goal is to train the model to predict in-game actions (e.g., jump, slide, sprint, etc.) based on real-time game data inputs, allowing the system to achieve high scores autonomously.
